# transport: s3

The S3 transporter puts logical WAL messages as *gzipped* objects in an S3 bucket partitioned by year, month and day in increasing order of time. This time is at the time of the PUT request creation, and *not* when the data was written to Postgres nor read from the pg-bifrost client.

## Key Construction

The basic construction of an S3 key for this transporter is defined as:
```
<bucket name>/<key space>/<year as YYYY>/<month as MM>/<day as DD>/<datetime>_<first wal record id>.gz
```

### Example

For a given configuration:
```
BIFROST_S3_BUCKET=test_bucket
BIFROST_S3_KEY_SPACE=test_files
```

A batch written at `2000:01:02 12:03:04` with the WAL record ID of the first record of `1336674354448` will be put at:
```
test_bucket/test_files/2000/01/02/2000_01_32_12_03_04_1336674354448.gz
```

You may also omit `BIFROST_S3_KEY_SPACE` which will result in an object being put at:
```$xslt
test_bucket/2000/01/02/2000_01_32_12_03_04_1336674354448.gz
```
