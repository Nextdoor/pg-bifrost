# pg-bifrost

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Nextdoor/pg-bifrost/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Nextdoor/pg-bifrost/tree/master)

pg-bifrost is a [logical decoding](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/logicaldecoding.html) tool for PostgresSQL that writes the database's stream of events (creates, inserts, and deletes) to [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). It is written in a modular manner that allows adding additional sinks such as AWS Firehose, AWS DynamoDB and non-AWS destinations as well.

## Installation

A precompiled binary for Linux AMD 64 can obtained under the github [Releases](https://github.com/Nextdoor/pg-bifrost/releases) tab. Additionally pg-bifrost can also be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nextdoor/pg-bifrost). Note that the docker image is built and deployed by the circleci [build](https://circleci.com/gh/Nextdoor/workflows/pg-bifrost).

## Example

**Startup:**

```
[Slava pg-bifrost.git]$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secretaccesskey
[Slava pg-bifrost.git]$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=accesskeyid
[Slava pg-bifrost.git]$ export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
[Slava pg-bifrost.git]$ pg-bifrost --dbname mydb --host 127.0.0.1 replicate --create-slot kinesis --kinesis-stream dbstream
```

**Input:**

```
CREATE TABLE customers (id serial primary key, first_name text, last_name text);

INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Hello', 'World');
INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Goodbye', 'World');
UPDATE customers SET last_name = 'Friends' where first_name = 'Hello';
DELETE FROM customers WHERE first_name = 'Goodbye';
```

**Output:**

```
{"time":"1970-01-01T00:00:01Z","lsn":"0/1510A58","table":"public.customers","operation":"INSERT","columns":{"first_name":{"new":{"q":"true","t":"text","v":"Hello"}},"id":{"new":{"q":"false","t":"integer","v":"1"}},"last_name":{"new":{"q":"true","t":"text","v":"World"}}}}
{"time":"1970-01-01T00:00:01Z","lsn":"0/1510B60","table":"public.customers","operation":"INSERT","columns":{"first_name":{"new":{"q":"true","t":"text","v":"Goodbye"}},"id":{"new":{"q":"false","t":"integer","v":"2"}},"last_name":{"new":{"q":"true","t":"text","v":"World"}}}}
{"time":"1970-01-01T00:00:01Z","lsn":"0/1510C20","table":"public.customers","operation":"UPDATE","columns":{"first_name":{"new":{"q":"true","t":"text","v":"Hello"}},"id":{"new":{"q":"false","t":"integer","v":"1"}},"last_name":{"new":{"q":"true","t":"text","v":"Friends"}}}}
{"time":"1970-01-01T00:00:01Z","lsn":"0/1510CA8","table":"public.customers","operation":"DELETE","columns":{"id":{"old":{"q":"false","t":"integer","v":"2"}}}}
```

**NOTE** 

`time` here is not the time this wal message has been replicated, nor is it when the time the message has been transported to the sink. It is the server time as reported in the wal binary. These appear to be uninplemented in Postgres versions 9.5 to 11.2 so they they take the epoch time in the marshalled (JSON) message. 

As such it does not provide any useful data. This is left in if there is support for this binary field in the future.

### replicate 
```
NAME:
   pg-bifrost replicate - start logical replication

USAGE:
   pg-bifrost replicate command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
     stdout    replicate to stdout
     kinesis   replicate to kinesis
     rabbitmq  replicate to rabbitmq

OPTIONS:
   --create-slot, -s                  Creates replication slot if it doesn't exist before replicating [$CREATE_SLOT]
   --workers value                    number of workers for transport (default: 1) [$WORKERS]
   --client-buffer-size value         number of messages to buffer from postgres (default: 10000) [$CLIENT_BUFFER_SIZE]
   --batch-flush-update-age value     amount of time to wait in milliseconds for a new message before batch is written. If a new message is added then the timer is reset. This is evaluated every second. (default: 500) [$BATCH_FLUSH_UPDATE_AGE]
   --batch-flush-max-age value        maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait before writing a batch. This overrides 'batch-flush-update-age'. This is evaluated every second. (default: 1000) [$BATCH_FLUSH_MAX_AGE]
   --batch-queue-depth value          number of batches that can be queued per worker (default: 2) [$BATCH_QUEUE_DEPTH]
   --batcher-memory-soft-limit value  maximum amount of memory to use when batching messages. Note this is only evaluated every 'batch-flush-timeout'. Also, note that if you use the 'partition' batcher-routing-method and have a high cardinality partition key you may need to tweak this value to create batches of meaningful size.

'transaction' will ensure that a batch will only ever have messages from a single transaction. This can be dangerous if your database does lots of small transactions. 'transaction-bucket' performs a hash to pick the partition. This will mean that entire transactions will go into the same partition but that partition may have other transactions as well. 'tablename' partitions on the table name of the message. (default: "none") [$PARTITION_METHOD]
   --batcher-partition-count value    number of buckets to use when bucketing partitions in partition-method='transaction-bucket'. (default: 1) [$PARTITION_COUNT]

## Configuration

pg-bifrost can be configured using cli arguments, environment variables, and a config file. See `--help` for a detailed list of options.

### Memory and Throughput

Config Var | Description
-- | --
workers | Number of workers that push write data to kinesis.
client-buffer-size | Number of messages to buffer from postgres
batch-flush-timeout | Number of milliseconds to wait for new messages before writing a batch
batch-queue-depth | Number of batches that can be queued per worker
max-memory-bytes | Maximum amount of memory to use when batching messages. Note that if you use the 'partition' batcher-routing-method and have a high cardinality partition key you may need to tweak this value to create batches of meaningful size.


### Filtering

pg-bifrost currently supports table level filtering in both a whitelist and blacklist mode. Use `whitelist` to include specific tables and `blacklist` to exclude tables. Note these are mutually exclusive.

Additionally, there is a regex mode to enable matching multiple tables at once, using `whitelist-regex` and `blacklist-regex`

### Marshalling

Config Var | Description
-- | --
no-marshal-old-value | Disable marshalling of the old value. This can help with performance by only writing the new values.
infer-updated-nulls  | Infers when a column has been updated from `NULL`, and ensures that `NULL` is present in the old value. Without this flag it is not possible for consumers to differentiate between an unchanged value and a value that has been updated from `NULL`.

In order for pg-bifrost to replicate TOAST-ed columns you must set `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` on the table containing TOAST columns. Postgres will then send the old and new values for each row written instead of just the current value. If you do not wish to include both the old and new values in your output then you can use `no-marshal-old-value` to disable outputting old values. It is important to note that setting replicate identity to `FULL` can cause severe performance implications. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/logical-replication-publication.html for details.

If your use case involves processing `UPDATE` operations to detect when a column has updated from `NULL` to a not `NULL` value then the `infer-updated-nulls` setting should be enabled. It is important to note that the accuracy of this behaviour relies on the relevant columns being included in the `REPLICA IDENTITY`. Columns that are not included in the `REPLICA IDENTITY` will always have a `NULL` old value in the output stream.

### Partitioning

One of the most important and complicated parts of the configuration is partitioning. Here is a cheat sheet for different types of partitioning strategies and how to achieve them.

**Config Options:**

Config Var | Description
-- | --
partition-method | determines how messages will be split into batches. Options are `none` (default) , `none`, `transaction`, and `transaction-bucket`. `transaction` will ensure that a batch will only ever have messages from a single transaction. This can be dangerous if your database does lots of small transactions. `transaction-bucket` performs a hash to pick the partition. This will mean that entire transactions will go into the same partition but that partition may have other transactions as well. `tablename` partitions on the table name of the message. (default: `none`)
batcher-routing-method | determines how to route batches to workers. Options are `round-robin` (default) and `partition`. If you require strict ordering of data then use `partition`. (default: `round-robin`)

**Cheat Sheet:**

Strategy | partition-method | batcher-routing-method
-- | -- | --
(default) Messages distributed across shards (unordered) | none | round-robin
Messages from the same transaction go to the same shard (unordered) | transaction-bucket | round-robin
Messages from the same transaction go to the same shard (ordered) | transaction-bucket | partition
Messages from the same table go to the same shard (unordered) | tablename | round-robin
Messages from the same table go to the same shard (ordered) | tablename | partition

### Profiling

pg-bifrost natively supports CPU and memory profiling via `pprof`. To start profiling of either, you can simply specify the filesystem location of each expected `pprof` file via `CPUPROFILE` and `MEMPROFILE`.

**CPU Profiling**

To end CPU profiling, you send pg-bifrost a `SIGUSR1` signal and the `pprof` file will be finalized and written.

*NOTE:* CPU profiling can only be done one time for any single run of pg-bifrost. Once a `SIGUSR1` is sent, further signals will have no effect in finalizing CPU profiling. A final CPU profile will also be written upon graceful shutdown of pg-bifrost, if it hasn't already been finalized.

**Memory Profiling**

To dump a memory profile, you send pg-bifrost a `SIGUSR2` signal and the `pprof` file will be written.

*NOTE:* CPU profiling **can** be done multiple times for any single run of pg-bifrost. A final memory profile will also be written upon graceful shutdown of pg-bifrost.

### Debugging

**Progress Tracker (Ledger) Dump**

In rare scenarios to investigate WAL standby acknowledgement issues to postgres (e.g., thrashing on duplicate data, a missing transaction, etc.) the ledger (the progress tracker's data structure to keep track of received and acknowledged transactions and their WAL messages) can be dumped to STDOUT by sending a `SIGIO` signal to pg-bifrost.
